### Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR

Dong et al. *medRxiv* [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129]

#### Keywords

- Diagnosis
- digital PCR

#### Main Findings

The authors present a digital PCR (dPCR) diagnostic test for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 103 individuals that were confirmed in a
follow-up to be infected, the standard qPCR test had a positivity
rate of 28.2% while the dPCR test detected 87.4% of the infections
by detecting an additional 61 positive cases. The authors also
tested samples from close contacts (early in infection stage) and
convalescing individuals (late in infection stage) and were able to
detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in many more samples using dPCR
compared to qPCR.

#### Limitations

I did not detect limitations.

#### Significance

The authors make a strong case for the need for a highly sensitive
and accurate confirmatory method for diagnosing COVID-19 during this
outbreak and present a potential addition to the diagnostic arsenal.
They propose a dPCR test that they present has a dramatically lower
false negative rate than the standard RT-qPCR tests and can be
especially beneficial in people with low viral load, whether they
are in the earlier or later stages of infection.
