A.  A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute
    respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted
    hospital patients

B.  diagnosis, serological assay, ELISA, RT-PCR

C.  While RT-PCR is being used currently to routinely diagnose infection
    with SARS-CoV-2, there are significant limitations to the use of a
    nucleic acid test that lead to a high false-negative rate. This
    article describes ELISAs that can measure IgM and IgG antibodies
    against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 to test samples from 238
    patients (153 positive by RT-PCR and 85 negative by RT-PCR) at
    different times after symptom onset. The positivity rate of the IgM
    and/or IgG ELISAs was greater than that of the RT-PCR (81.5%
    compared to 64.3%) with similar positive rates in the confirmed and
    suspected cases (83% and 78.8%, respectively), suggesting that many
    of the suspected but RT-PCR-negative cases were also infected. The
    authors also found that the ELISAs have higher positive rates later
    after symptom onset while RT-PCR is more effective as a diagnostic
    test early during the infection.

D.  I cannot identify any limitations to this study.

E.  The authors make a strong case for using a combination of ELISA and
    RT-PCR for diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2, especially
    considering the dynamics of positivity rates of RT-PCR and ELISA.
    Fewer false-negative diagnoses would improve infection control and
    patient management.
