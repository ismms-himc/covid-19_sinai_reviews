#### Keywords


CoVID-19, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, liver, organoids, Cholangiocyte

*Summary of Findings*:

-   Used human liver ductal organoids to determine ACE2+ cholangiocytes
    in healthy liver (2.92% of all cells) are infectable and support
    SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.

-   Plaque-purified SARS-CoV-2 viral infection disrupted organoid
    barrier and bile transporting functions of cholangiocytes through
    dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation (CLDN1)
    and bile acid transportation (ASBT and CFTR).

*Limitations*:

-   Unclear if liver damage observed in patients due to direct
    cholangiocyte infection or due to secondary immune/cytokine effects.
    This study argues for direct damage as it lacks immune contexture;
    but further studies needed with autopsy samples or organoid-immune
    cell co-culture to conclude strongly.

-   Would be important to measure cholangiocyte-intrinsic anti-viral
    response and alarmins secreted upon infection, and furthermore study
    tropism of various immune cells to conditioned media from organoids
    infected with SARS-CoV-2.

-   Does not address how cirrhotic liver or
    alcohol/smoking/obesity-associated liver organoids respond to
    SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and replication, worth pursuing to
    experimentally address clinical data indicating co-morbidities.

#### Significance


-   Useful model to rapidly study drug activity against SARS-CoV-2
    infection in liver, while monitoring baseline liver damage.

-   Liver abnormality observed in &gt;50% of CoVID-19 patients; the
    results from this study could explain the bile acid accumulation and
    consequent liver damage observed.
